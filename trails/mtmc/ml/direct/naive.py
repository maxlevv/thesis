def log_ml(

    """
    Directly samples the marginal likelihood of the MTMC model
    from the corresponding, analytically derived formula.
    In particular the group assignments are sampled.

    This particular implementation takes advantage of the "logsumexp trick",
    which allows to work with log-probabilities hopefully reducing numeric errors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transitions: ndarray
        Transitions betweens states described by their source and destination state.
        Thus, the shape is: ``(n,2)``,
        where ``n`` is the number of states and
        ``transitions[i,] = [source_state_i, destination_state_i]``.
    group_assignment_p: ndarray
        Group assignment probabilities, i.e.,
        for each transition it holds a probability distribution over groups.
        Thus, the shape is ``(n,g)``,
        where ``n`` is the number of transitions and ``g`` is the number of groups.
    alpha: ndarray
        The dirichlet prior parameters of the model.
        They have the same dimenstion as the transtition probabilities.
        Thus the shape is ``(g,m,m)``,
        where ``g`` is the number of groups and ``m`` is the number of states.
    n_samples: int
        Number of Gibbs runs.
        (Default: 100)
