# Bayesian Inference for Composition of Hypotheses in Sequential Data

This repository contains the code needed to reproduce the experiments conducted in my master thesis "Bayesian Inference for Composition of Hypotheses in Sequential Data". 

Most visuals can be obtained from the notebooks such as 

* `kappa_proposal_exp.ipynb`, where an exponential distribution is used as a prior for the concentration parameter Kappa or
* `kappa_proposal_uniform.ipynb`, utilizing an uniform prior.

* `multimodal_3.ipynb` introduces multimodal data using a sparse prior

To run * `mh_wikispedia.ipynb` add a data folder containing the wikispeedia data set following the repo below
